# Context

The vocabulary this codebase uses for itself. Terms here are the ones that turn
out to be load-bearing — where using the wrong word leads to the wrong design,
or where two things that sound alike are not the same thing.

This is a glossary, not a spec. How anything works lives in `DESIGN.md`,
`test/PLACEMENT-PLAN.md`, or the code.

## Modes

**Probe Mode** — the extension is switched on for a tab. Hovering outlines
whatever is under the pointer; clicking selects. Everything below happens inside
it. Signalled by `ccp-probe-active` on `<html>`.

**Selection** — one element is locked in, and the toolbar is showing. The
extension has exactly one selection at a time. Its truthiness *is* the state:
there is no separate flag.

**Redline** — held-Option spacing measurement. A sub-mode of Selection: it
cannot be entered without one, and every path that drops the selection ends it.

**Edit Mode** — live-tuning the selected element through a panel. Also a
sub-mode of Selection, and the only feature that writes to the page.

Redline and Edit Mode differ in who owns the pointer. Redline is a held
modifier and the page underneath stays live. Edit Mode owns the mouse for as
long as it lasts — the page is **inert**, meaning clicks, double-clicks and
context menus over it are swallowed so a scrub across a page of links cannot
navigate away mid-drag.

## Editing

**Edit** — one property's before→after on one element. Not "a change to an
element": each property is tracked separately, because each is a separate line
in the block and a separate thing to undo.

**Edit panel** — the draggable control surface. An *inspector column*: one
narrow column of titled groups, chosen over eleven alternatives in
`test/edit-ui-prototypes.html`.

**Tether** — what says "this panel edits that element" in Edit Mode, once the
selection box has been taken away. Four ticks at the element's edge midpoints
plus a dashed run from the panel to the tick on the facing edge. Chosen over
eleven alternatives in `test/edit-association-prototypes.html`.

The box had to go, and the reason is the whole design: the panel writes
`border-width`, `border-color`, `border-radius` and `box-shadow`, and the box is
a ring drawn 2px outside the element — sitting on exactly the four things being
judged. The tether works only in the ring of space *outside* the element, and
`test/tether.mjs` sweeps that as a property rather than trusting it.

Not the same thing as Redline, though they share a dashed vocabulary on purpose.
Redline measures the distance between two elements and puts a number on it; the
tether asserts a relationship between chrome and an element and carries no
value. A run that is longer means the panel was dragged further away, nothing
more.

They share the dash and not the weight. A redline guide is an aside at 1px — it
extends an edge so a measurement has something to measure against, and should
stay quieter than the number it serves. The run is the only thing saying which
element the panel edits, so it is drawn at the ticks' own 2px: the tether reads
as one object at one weight, rather than two solid stubs joined by a hairline.

**Colour picker** — its own root, not part of the panel. It began as a child of
the panel and that was the bug: it was clipped by the panel's overflow, locked to
the panel's width, and painted over the very rows it was tuning, with no exit but
an Escape nothing advertised. It is now a surface in its own right — named beside
the panel in `OUR_ROOTS`, in `isOwnEditChrome`, and in the click allowlist — which
is what lets it be dismissed the three ways anything else is: its close button,
the swatch that opened it, or Escape.

**Delta block** — what the panel copies: the same source pointer Copy Code
emits, plus one line per edit. This is the product. The panel is how you produce
it.

**Origin vs. from** — two different "before"s, and conflating them makes an undo
stack wrong. *Origin* is the value at first touch and belongs to the delta: the
block should say where a property started, however many times it was nudged
since. *From* is the value a particular gesture is leaving and belongs to the
undo entry, so one ⌘Z gives back one change rather than the whole session.

**Gesture** — a continuous interaction that repaints many times and must land as
one undo entry: a scrub, a held arrow key, a drag in the colour picker.

**Token family** — a name-prefixed scale a stepper can walk (`--title-sm/md/lg`,
`text-xs…text-2xl`, `p-0…p-96`). Membership is decided by the *values*, not by
the names: any shared prefix with two rungs at two different numbers is a
family, whatever its steps are called.

The names were tried first — a step had to be numeric or one of thirty-one words
we had written down — and that was a guess about how other people name things.
It was wrong about most of the field (`--radius`, `--color-primary`,
`--space-small`, `--gap-xxs`), and it failed silently, so a page full of tokens
reported none. What survives from that design is the only part that was load
bearing: a family of one is not a family, because a scale you cannot step along
is not a scale. Two names at the same number are the same statement in values,
and are not a family either.

**Rung** — one distinct value in a family, and the first name that claims it. A
value is *on* a rung when its resolved value matches within half a pixel;
anything else is *off-scale*, and off-scale claims no token. Aliases collapse
onto the rung they share rather than sitting on it twice, so one press of the
stepper always moves the page.

**In scope** — the tokens a *particular element* can see, which is the only set
worth offering. Found by asking the element what custom properties resolve on
it, rather than by reading the stylesheets for names and hoping they reach it.
Custom properties inherit, so the element is the authority — and asking it works
regardless of where the declaration came from, including sheets this extension
is not allowed to read.

That last part is why the stylesheet walk still exists but no longer leads. Two
things an element genuinely cannot report: which *class* means which value
(`.p-4` is 1rem), and the *text of the declaration* that won — the only place a
`var()` can be seen, and so the only way to know a value is a token rather than
merely equal to one.

**Own chrome** — the DOM this extension injects, all `ccp-`-prefixed. Kept
distinct from the page's own DOM everywhere: in hit-testing, in what the info
label reports, and in which stylesheets the token resolver reads. The
extension's design tokens are not the page's design tokens.

## Copy

**Pointer** — the `# key: value` header naming an element: where it came from in
source, how to find it again, what it says. Shared by Copy Code and the delta
block, so both name an element in the same dialect.

**Skeleton** — the depth-limited HTML fallback, used only when no source file
and no component name could be found. With a pointer, the agent should read the
real source rather than a rendered copy of it.

**Shape** — the middle HTML block: the root tag, then one condensed line per
child (`td > button.btn-ghost "View" onClick={openInvoice}`), then the close. It
describes rather than locates, which is why its segments carry no `:nth-child` —
locating is the selector field's job.

**Located** — whether the payload names a source file or a component. Not
"whether one was found": a field switched off is a field the agent never sees,
so it does not count. This is what decides whether the HTML block falls back to
the full subtree.

**Diagnosis fields** — `layout`, `styles`, `props`. The three that describe what
the browser did rather than naming a construct, off by default, and the only ones
that cost anything to compute. `props` is the sole field in the tool that reports
values rather than names — see DESIGN.md.
